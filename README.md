## Data sources

## Baseline

## Model

## Experiments

To change the default tracking location to another folder you can use put the following to your `.env` file:
`MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI="file:///home/<path>/mlruns"`

To see the experiments:
1. (Optional) Load your environment variable from the .env file: `source .env`
2. Run `mlflow ui --backend-store-uri $MLFLOW_TRCKING_URI` to view the tracked experiments. (If you did not change the MLFLOW_TRCKING_URI, just run `mlflow ui`)
